//45. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function createCar(manufacturer: string, model: string, ...details: [string, any][]): object {
    let car: {[key: string]: any} = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model
    };

    details.forEach(([key, value]) => {
        car[key] = value;
    });

    return car;
}

let carInfo = createCar("Toyota", "Corolla", ["color", "red"], ["year", 2022]);

console.log(carInfo);
