//  Arrow Function
// An arrow function in TypeScript is a concise way to define functions using a more compact syntax compared to traditional function expressions. Arrow functions are also sometimes called "fat arrow" functions due to the use of the **`=>`** syntax. They were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and have since become a popular way to write functions in JavaScript and TypeScript.
const addWithArrow = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
console.log(addWithArrow(10, 20)); // Output: 30
// - The `addWithArrow` variable is assigned an arrow function that performs the same addition operation.
