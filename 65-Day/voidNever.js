//  void & never
// In TypeScript, `void` and `never` are two distinct types that represent different concepts:
// 1. **`void` Type:**
//     - The `void` type is used to indicate the absence of a value. It represents functions that do not return any value or return `undefined`.
//     - It's often used to annotate functions that perform actions or side effects but don't produce a meaningful result that needs to be assigned or captured.
// Example
// void
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
function noReturnValue() {
    // This function doesn't return a value (implicitly returns undefined).
}
// In the `greet` function, it logs a message but doesn't return anything, so its return type is `void`.
// 2. **`never` Type:**
//  - The `never` type is used to represent values that never occur. It's typically associated with functions that never return, either because they throw exceptions, enter infinite loops, or have unreachable code.
//     Example:
function throwError(message) {
    throw new Error(message);
}
function infiniteLoop() {
    while (true) {
        // This function never exits (infinite loop).
    }
}
//     In the `throwError` function, it throws an error and never returns normally. In the `infiniteLoop` function, it enters an infinite loop and never exits, resulting in a `never` return type.
