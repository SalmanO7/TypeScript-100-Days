// Literal Types
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
// Literal types are a type system feature in TypeScript that allow you to specify exactly which values are allowed for a particular variable or function parameter.
//  Instead of using a general type like `string` or `number`, you can specify a literal type that can only take on a specific value.
// For example, you can define a literal type like this:
let direction;
// In this case, the `direction` variable can only be assigned one of the four literal string values: "left", "right", "up", or "down". Any other value would result in a type error.
// Literal types are especially useful in scenarios where you want to be very explicit about the allowed values for a variable, parameter, or property.
//  They provide a level of type safety by ensuring that only specific values are accepted, which can help catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.
// Here's an example of using a literal type in a function parameter:
function setColor(color) {
    // ...
}
// In this case, the `color` parameter can only be one of the three specified string literals: "red", "green", or "blue".
//  This helps prevent potential bugs by restricting the input to a predefined set of values.
// Literal types can be combined with other TypeScript features like union types, intersection types,
//  and more to create powerful and expressive type definitions in your code.
