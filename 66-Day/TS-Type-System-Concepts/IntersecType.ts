//  **Intersection Type**

// An intersection type in TypeScript allows you to combine multiple types into one,
//  creating a new type that has all the properties and functionalities of the individual types being intersected.
// Here's a simple example to illustrate:

type FirstType = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
};

type SecondType = {
    address: string;
    phone: string;
};

type CombinedType = FirstType & SecondType;

const person: CombinedType = {
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 30,
    address: '123 Main St',
    phone: '123-456-7890'
};


// In this example, we have two types, `FirstType` and `SecondType`.
// We then create a new type `CombinedType` by using the `&` (intersection) operator, which combines the properties of both `FirstType` and `SecondType`.
// The `CombinedType` includes all properties from both types, allowing you to use them together.
