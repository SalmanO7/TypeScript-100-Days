//  Union Types

// Annotating a variable with union types means specifying that the variable can hold values of multiple types.
//  Union types in TypeScript are denoted using the `|` symbol between the types.

// For example:

let myVar: string | number;

myVar = "Hello"; // Valid assignment
console.log(myVar)

myVar = 42;       // Valid assignment
console.log(myVar)

// In this code, `myVar` is annotated with a union type of `string | number`, which means it can hold either string or number values.
// You can assign values of either type to it without causing a type error.
//  However, if you try to assign a value of a different type (e.g., `boolean`), TypeScript will report a type error because it's not part of the specified union type.
